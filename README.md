# Vim---Monokai
Monokai for vim

I loved the default theme for Sublime text but have really
began adopting vim for efficiency.

# Installation

Replace your vimrc file with mine. It is typically found in 
/usr/share/vim
You will probably have to root to accomplish this

Then add the monokai.vim file to your colors directory. It is typically
found in /usr/share/vim/vim74/colors

(the 74 is the version so your directory may have a different name)
